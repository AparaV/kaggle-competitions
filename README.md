# Kaggle Data Science Competitions

My machine learning models for the following Kaggle data science competitions:

## Getting Started Competitions

### 1. Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

### 2. House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
Initially trained a linear model in TensorFlow with a score of `2.538`.
A relatively simple neural network improved the score to `2.238`.
See the jupyter notebook for scope for improvement.
